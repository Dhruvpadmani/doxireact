# Database Migration Complete

The database redesign has been successfully implemented! Here's a summary of the changes:

## What Was Changed

### 1. New Database Structure

- **Consolidated User Model**: Combined User, Patient, and Doctor into a single User model
- **Role-Based Subdocuments**: Added `patientData` and `doctorData` subdocuments
- **Eliminated Duplication**: No more duplicate data between User/Patient/Doctor models

### 2. Files Updated

- `backend/models/User.js` - Enhanced with role-based subdocuments
- `backend/routes/auth.js` - Updated for new authentication structure
- `backend/routes/patient.js` - Updated to work with new User model
- `backend/routes/doctor.js` - Updated to work with new User model
- `backend/routes/appointments.js` - Updated to work with new User model
- All other route files updated to reference User model instead of separate models

### 3. New Files Created

- `backend/migrations/backup-existing.js` - Script to backup existing data
- `backend/migrations/migrate-users.js` - Script to migrate data to new structure
- `backend/migrations/old_models.js` - Temporary models for accessing old data during migration

## Migration Steps

### 1. Before Running Migration (ALWAYS BACKUP FIRST)

```bash
cd backend
node migrations/backup-existing.js
```

### 2. Run the Migration

```bash
node migrations/migrate-users.js
```

### 3. Verification

After migration, verify that:

- All patient data is accessible through the User model
- All doctor data is accessible through the User model
- Authentication and authorization still work correctly
- All routes return expected data

## Post-Migration Cleanup (Optional)

Once you've verified everything works correctly, you may:

1. Remove the old Patient and Doctor model files:
    - `backend/models/Patient.js`
    - `backend/models/Doctor.js`

2. Remove migration scripts if no longer needed:
    - `backend/migrations/` directory

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Simplified Data Management**: All user data in a single collection
2. **Better Performance**: Fewer JOINs/lookups needed
3. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for user-related data
4. **Consistency**: Unified authentication and profile management
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new roles or attributes

## API Changes

The API responses remain largely the same, but internally they now fetch data from the consolidated User model. This
should not require changes to frontend code.

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can:

1. Restore from the backup created by `backup-existing.js`
2. Revert the User model to its original state
3. Restore the original Patient and Doctor models from the .backup files

## Testing Recommendations

After migration, test:

- User registration and login
- Patient profile access and updates
- Doctor profile access and updates
- Appointment booking and management
- All role-based functionality
- Data integrity across the application
