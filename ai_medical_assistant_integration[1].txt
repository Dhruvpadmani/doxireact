# AI Medical Assistant Integration in Doctor Online Appointment System

---

## 1. Role of AI vs Doctor
The AI assistant is designed to support patients with general information, symptom collection, appointment scheduling, and reminders. **Doctors remain the final authority** for diagnosis, prescriptions, and treatment decisions. AI is an assistant, not a replacement for doctors.

## 2. Rules & Conditions

### ‚úÖ Allowed (AI Can Do):
- Answer general health questions (e.g., *What is diabetes?*).
- Explain common symptoms (e.g., fever causes).
- Provide preventive health tips (diet, exercise).
- Help in appointment booking (suggest time slots, book/cancel/reschedule).
- Send reminders & notifications (appointments, medicines).
- Act as a FAQ bot (hospital timings, payment options).
- Collect patient symptoms & create summary report for doctor.
- Detect keywords for emergencies and advise hospital visit.
- Suggest which specialist doctor to consult.

## 3. Workflow of AI + Doctor Interaction
1. Patient asks question ‚Üí AI checks if general or medical-sensitive.  
2. If **general** ‚Üí AI gives response directly.  
3. If **medical-sensitive** ‚Üí AI marks it as *Pending Doctor Approval*.  
4. Doctor reviews AI draft, approves or edits.  
5. Final advice/prescription always comes from doctor.

## 4. Database Integration Example
**Table: ai_chats**
- chat_id (Primary Key)  
- patient_id (Foreign Key)  
- question (Patient's query)  
- ai_response (AI's reply)  
- status (general, pending_doctor, resolved)  
- created_at (Timestamp)

## 5. Example Scenarios
- **Patient:** *What are symptoms of flu?* ‚Üí **AI:** Explains common flu symptoms ‚úÖ  
- **Patient:** *Which medicine should I take for chest pain?* ‚Üí **AI:** Emergency warning & alert doctor üö®  
- **Patient:** *Book appointment with Dr. Patel tomorrow evening.* ‚Üí **AI:** Books appointment üìÖ  

---

## 6. Emergency Handling
If patient mentions keywords such as **chest pain, accident, or severe bleeding**, AI will:
- Immediately advise hospital visit.  
- Notify the doctor.  

This ensures patient safety and compliance with real-world healthcare practices.

## 7. Why Doctor is Still Important
- Prescriptions can only be given by licensed doctors.  
- Legal responsibility for diagnosis lies with doctors.  
- Accurate diagnosis requires human expertise.  
- Patients trust doctors more than automated systems.
