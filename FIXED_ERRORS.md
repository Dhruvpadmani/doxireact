# Fixed Errors

## Registration Error Fixed

- **Issue**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'patientId')`
- **Root Cause**: User model schema was missing patientData and doctorData subdocuments, and pre-validation middleware
  was trying to access undefined properties
- **Solution**:
    1. Added patientData and doctorData subdocuments to the User schema
    2. Updated pre-validation middleware to check if subdocuments exist before accessing properties
    3. Updated registration logic to properly initialize role-specific data

## Database Structure Migration Completed

- **Old Structure**: Separate User, Patient, Doctor models with duplicated data
- **New Structure**: Single User model with role-based subdocuments (patientData, doctorData)
- **Benefits**:
    - Eliminates data duplication
    - Simplified data management
    - Better performance
    - Improved maintainability

## Files Updated to Work with New Structure

- All backend route files updated to use new User model structure
- Middleware updated to work with new structure
- Frontend will need updates to handle new API response structure
