## General Issues

### 1. Missing Error Handling Patterns
- Components don't consistently handle API errors or mock operation failures
- No centralized error handling or user feedback mechanisms
- Lack of retry mechanisms for failed operations

### 2. Inconsistent Data Models
- Different components use slightly different data structures for similar entities
- Missing validation on data entry forms
- No standardized approach to data normalization

### 3. Poor State Management
- Heavy reliance on localStorage with no synchronization strategies
- No optimistic updates for better UX
- Race conditions possible when multiple tabs are open

---

## Insert Operations

### 1. Medical Reports Upload
**File:** `src/pages/patient/MedicalReports.jsx`
**Issue:** Mock upload function doesn't actually process files
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Users can't upload real medical reports
**Code Snippet:**
```javascript
const handleUpload = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  // Mock upload - doesn't actually process files
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000))
  // Creates fake report object
}
```

**Problems:**
- Form validation is basic
- No actual file processing happens
- Files array is mocked rather than containing real file data
- No error handling for upload failures

### 2. Appointment Booking
**File:** `src/pages/patient/BookAppointment.jsx`
**Issue:** Mock booking doesn't integrate with backend
**Severity:** High
**Impact:** Users can't book real appointments
**Code Snippet:**
```javascript
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  setLoading(true)
  
  try {
    // Mock appointment booking
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000))
    setSuccess(true)
    
    // Creates appointment in localStorage only
    const newAppointment = { /* ... */ }
    
    // Saves to localStorage but not to backend
    localStorage.setItem(`patientAppointments_${user.id}`, JSON.stringify(updatedAppointments))
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Booking failed:', error)
  } finally {
    setLoading(false)
  }
}
```

**Problems:**
- No integration with actual appointment booking API
- Data only saved to localStorage
- No validation of appointment conflicts
- No handling of unavailable time slots

## Update Operations

### 1. Appointment Editing
**File:** `src/pages/patient/BookAppointment.jsx`
**Issue:** Mock update doesn't persist changes to backend
**Severity:** High
**Impact:** Users can't update real appointments
**Code Snippet:**
```javascript
const handleUpdateAppointment = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  setLoading(true)
  
  try {
    // Mock update
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000))
    
    // Updates localStorage only
    const updatedAppointments = appointments.map(apt => 
      apt.id === selectedAppointment.id 
        ? { ...apt, ...editForm }
        : apt
    )
    localStorage.setItem(`patientAppointments_${user.id}`, JSON.stringify(updatedAppointments))
    
    setShowEditModal(false)
    alert('Appointment updated successfully!')
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Update failed:', error)
    alert('Failed to update appointment. Please try again.')
  } finally {
    setLoading(false)
  }
}
```

**Problems:**
- No actual update to backend systems
- Alert-based feedback instead of proper UI indicators
- No optimistic updates
- Basic error handling with generic alerts

### 2. Profile Updates
**Missing Implementation:** No dedicated profile update functionality found
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Users can't update their personal information
**Notes:** Profile updates should be available but are not implemented

---

## Delete Operations

### 1. Appointment Deletion
**File:** `src/pages/patient/BookAppointment.jsx`
**Issue:** Mock deletion doesn't remove from backend
**Severity:** High
**Impact:** Users can't cancel real appointments
**Code Snippet:**
```javascript
const handleDeleteAppointment = async (appointmentId) => {
  if (window.confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this appointment?')) {
    try {
      // Mock delete
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
      
      // Removes from localStorage only
      const updatedAppointments = appointments.filter(apt => apt.id !== appointmentId)
      setAppointments(updatedAppointments)
      localStorage.setItem(`patientAppointments_${user.id}`, JSON.stringify(updatedAppointments))
      
      alert('Appointment deleted successfully!')
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Delete failed:', error)
      alert('Delete failed. Please try again.')
    }
  }
}
```

**Problems:**
- No actual cancellation with backend systems
- Confirmation dialog is basic browser alert
- No undo capability
- Data only removed from localStorage
- No notification to doctor/admin about cancellation

### 2. Report Deletion
**Missing Implementation:** No delete functionality for medical reports
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Users can't remove medical reports
**Notes:** Delete buttons/icons may be present but not functional

### 3. Prescription Deletion
**Missing Implementation:** No delete functionality for prescriptions
**Severity:** Low
**Impact:** Users can't delete prescriptions (which may be appropriate for medical records)
**Notes:** Prescriptions are typically not deletable by patients in real systems

---

## Data Persistence Issues

### 1. LocalStorage Dependency
**Multiple Files Affected**
**Issue:** Heavy reliance on localStorage with no backend synchronization
**Severity:** Critical
**Impact:** Data loss risk, no cross-device sync
**Problems:**
- Data only persists in browser storage
- No backup or recovery mechanisms
- Clearing browser data loses all information
- No conflict resolution between devices

### 2. User-Specific Storage Keys
**File:** Multiple patient panel files
**Issue:** Using user-specific localStorage keys but no cleanup
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Potential storage bloat over time
**Code Pattern:**
```javascript
localStorage.setItem(`patientAppointments_${user.id}`, JSON.stringify(appointments))
localStorage.getItem(`patientReports_${user.id}`)
localStorage.getItem(`patientPrescriptions_${user.id}`)
```

**Problems:**
- No cleanup of old user data
- Keys accumulate over time
- No size monitoring or limits

### 3. Data Inconsistency
**Multiple Files Affected**
**Issue:** Same data stored in multiple locations without synchronization
**Severity:** High
**Impact:** Data inconsistency between different views
**Examples:**
- Appointments stored separately for patient and globally
- Reports duplicated in different formats
- No synchronization mechanism between views

---

## UI/UX Issues

### 1. Mock Operation Feedback
**Multiple Files Affected**
**Issue:** Using alerts and timeouts instead of proper loading states
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Poor user experience
**Examples:**
```javascript
// Using alerts instead of integrated feedback
alert('Appointment updated successfully!')

// Fixed timeouts instead of actual processing
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000))
```

### 2. Form Validation
**Multiple Files Affected**
**Issue:** Basic form validation with limited user guidance
**Severity:** Medium
**Impact:** Poor data quality, frustrating user experience
**Problems:**
- Minimal client-side validation
- No real-time validation feedback
- Generic error messages
- No accessibility considerations

### 3. Loading States
**Multiple Files Affected**
**Issue:** Inconsistent loading states and error handling
**Severity:** Low
**Impact:** Confusing user experience during operations
**Problems:**
- Generic spinners without context
- No skeleton screens or progressive loading
- No error recovery suggestions
